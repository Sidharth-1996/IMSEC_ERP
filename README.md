# AKTU ERP Webview App

This Android application converts the AKTU ERP website into a mobile application using the WebView functionality in Android. It provides a seamless and responsive user experience, allowing users to access the AKTU ERP platform directly from their mobile devices.

## Features

- **WebView Integration**: The app uses Android's WebView to load the AKTU ERP website within the application.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to handle different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on mobile devices.
- **Easy Access**: No need to open a browserâ€”simply launch the app to access the AKTU ERP portal.
- **Secure**: Ensures that all communications with the ERP system are secure, just like when accessed through a browser.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    https://github.com/Sidharth-1996/IMSEC_ERP.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the app on your Android device or emulator.

## How It Works

The app leverages Android's WebView component to load the AKTU ERP website within the application. WebView is a view that displays web pages as part of your activity layout. Here's a brief overview of how it's implemented:

- **WebView Setup**: The WebView is configured to load the AKTU ERP URL.
- **Permissions**: The app requests the necessary internet permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml file.
- **WebViewClient**: A WebViewClient is used to manage page navigation within the WebView.

## Usage

- Launch the app on your Android device.
- The AKTU ERP website will load automatically.
- Interact with the ERP system as you would in a web browser.

## Technologies Used

- **Android Studio**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android development.
- **Java/Kotlin**: Programming languages used for Android app development.
- **WebView**: Android component used to display web content within an app.
